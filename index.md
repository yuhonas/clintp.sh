## who?

Clint grew up in Melbourne, Australia in the 80's and was an unwilling combatant in the [console wars](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/sega/33279/sega-vs-nintendo-revisiting-the-deadliest-console-war),
 my passion with computers & programming started with typing lengthy programs from [Commodore 64 magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zzap!64)
only to see many of them uneventfully fail (still unsure how this didn't lead to an aversion to programming)

I went on to study Computer Science at Swinburne University and am also deeply intrigued by the Social Sciences, particulary Psychology, Sociology and Economics in my professional life i've been a business owner, engineer, senior engineer, engineering team/delivery lead, product owner and solutions architect and was recently involved in a startup from seed to exit.

These days I love travelling with ~25 countries under my belt, hiking, coffee and alcohol (not in any kind of depraved alcohol could serve as a substitute for breakfast type love but more of an intense fascination with its production and how it could be perceived as a distiliation of a culture)
