## who?

I grew up in Melbourne, Australia in the 80's, an unwilling combatant in the [console wars](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/sega/33279/sega-vs-nintendo-revisiting-the-deadliest-console-war),
 my passion for computing started with typing lengthy programs from [Commodore 64 magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zzap!64)
only to see many uneventfully fail (still unsure how this didn't lead to an aversion to programming)

I went on to study Computer Science at Swinburne University and am also deeply intrigued by the Social Sciences, particularly Psychology, Sociology and Economics. In my professional life I have been a business owner, engineer, senior engineer, delivery lead, engineering manager, product owner, solutions architect and involved in a startup from seed to exit.

My most recent position was as an Engineering Manager at [GOAT](https://www.goat.com) in LA, All in all I enjoy leading teams and organisations on rewarding journeys.

Outside of work I love traveling with ~25 countries under my belt, hiking, studying spanish, reading, coffee (trying to perfect my latte art) and alcohol (not in any kind of intense restraining order type love but more of a gentle fascination with its production and how it could be perceived as a distillation of a culture)
